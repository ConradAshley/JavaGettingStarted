# JavaGettingStarted
## Accompanying exercises for Intro to Java for New Engineers learning path

### Prerequisites for this Learning Path
* To follow this learning path, first make sure you have a PluralSight subscription
* Make sure you have set up a GitHub account using your Principal ID under the [Principal USIS Organization](https://github.com/principalusis)
* Install either IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition, or Visual Studio Code on your local system
* Install Gradle on your local system using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/), [PowerShell](https://chocolatey.org/install), or from the [Gradle Website](https://gradle.org/install/)

### Exercise Instructions
* Implement each of the tests one at a time, top down
* Each of the tests in the exercise files will have a @Disabled attribute that must be deleted before that test will run.
* Remove these only as you as you begin working on a new test...do NOT remove all of them at once
* Think about what the tests are in this order and be prepared to discuss it during Office Hours.  There will also be places in the code where you will be asked to answer a question or explain why you did something
* Make sure you commit each change you make as soon as the test you are working on passes so we can look at your progression through the exercise and discuss why you made those choices 

### PluralSight links
  * Week One
    * Go to the PluralSight course [Getting Started with Programming in Java](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/getting-started-programming-java/table-of-contents)
      * Go through lessons 1 - 3 on PluralSight (1 hr 20 mins)
        * Course Overview
        * Creating your First Java App
        * Variables, Data Types, and Math Operators
      * Fork the [JavaGettingStarted](https://github.com/gartee-john-PFG/JavaGettingStarted) repository into your Principal GitHub account
        * Clone your fork repository to your local machine
          * **Note** when you work on the following exercises, be sure to commit after modifying each test
            * push your changes back up to your fork (git push origin HEAD), so your coach can see each individual commit
            * use good comments on your commits, so we can easily follow your progress
            * we can discuss any issues you encounter during Office Hours
        * Work through the coding lesson under the src/test/java directory 
          * WeekOneExercisesPartOne.java
      * Go through lesson 4 on PluralSight (40 mins)
        * Conditional Logic and Block Statements
        * Work through the coding lesson WeekOneExercisesPartTwo.java
      * make sure you push your changes back to your fork on GitHub, so they are visible to the coach during office hours
  * Week Two
    * Go to the PluralSight course [Getting Started with Programming in Java](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/getting-started-programming-java/table-of-contents)
      * Go through lessons 5 (30 min)
        * Looping and Arrays
     * Go through the WeekTwoExercisePartOne.java file in src/test/java and implement each test in the /src/main/java/BowlingGame.java class
        * Make a Git commit after implementing each test with the minimum amount of code required to make the test pass
          * this may including just putting in a literal value...do not add any additional code
          * Hint:  If you complete implementing a test and the next test passes w/o any changes to BowlingGame.java, you did too much and should start over from the previous test.
     * Go through lessons 6 - 7 (1 hrs)
       * Understanding Methods
       * Working with Strings   
     * Go through the WeekTwoExercisePartTwo.java file in src/test/java and implement each test in the /src/main/java/FizzBuzz.java class
       * Make a Git commit after implementing each test with the minimum amount of code required to make the test pass
         * this may including just putting in a literal value...do not add any additional code
         * Hint:  If you complete implementing a test and the next test passes w/o any changes to FizzBuzz.java, you did too much and should start over from the previous test.
     * Go back to the PluralSight course [Getting Started with Programming in Java](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/getting-started-programming-java/table-of-contents)
     * Go through lessions 8 - 9 (1 hrs)
       * String Formatting
       * More About Data Types
     * Go through the WeekTwoExercisePartThree.java file in src/test/java and implement each test
       * Make a Git commit after implementing each test with the minimum amount of code required to make the test pass
           * this may including just putting in a literal value...do not add any additional code
           * Hint:  If you complete implementing a test and the next test passes w/o any changes, you did too much and should remove your changes and try something simpler.
